# Description

`/public` is a simple code export from `webflow.com` for `coronawhy.org` website (July 13th, 2020)

`Dockerfile` packages the website into very slim alpine based docker image, via node and [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve). 


## TODO

- repackage into webserver backend more suitable for production like `nginx` instead of `serve` (will need extra configuring on top of nginx image)


### Issues

The dynamic features of webflow platform don't work and need reimplementing
