This is what CW is about: organizing - with knowledge, curiosity, perseverance, ICT tools, and such - a part of the global brain that serves human society to be coherent, healthy, loving, regenerative, mature, aligned with its natural ecosystems. In the end to set conditions to migrate to Mars.<br>c) &quot;All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler is unaware&quot; - Martin Buber<br>By the way, this hypercrisis, is unprecedented in human history, so it&#x27;s an existential one, a unchartered terrain for which we have no map. The &#x27;world&#x27; (anthropocentric?) is not be saved, no need to, it will be perfectly without us, without our life form (or, what&#x27;s humanity&#x27;s unique purpose in all this?). It&#x27;s about learning to adapt, to survice and evolve as species.<br>I&#x27;ve been deeply involved in similar expeditions and collaborations pertaining to climate change and energy transition.

I truly believe that dangerous things like coronavirus are possible in the modern society only because people are competing against each other and don’t want to share their knowledge and competence, and work together in order to find a solution for a problem.Stupidity, ignorance and limitness has no nationality, it’s just a common thing that killing this world and COVID-19 is just one of the challenges. I’m here to open everything that should be open for the humanity,  build the collaboration between people, speed up the innovation and start the development of the research infrastructure that will allow to bring Science back to the policy table, and quickly respond to the current and future challenges. I would say, we should be prepared for the technological future and don’t afraid to disrupt the world.

Then I saw Artur’s message and joined CoronaWhy and now I’m on this amazing journey with a bunch of awesome folks that want to help too. I found a place where my weird skill mix can be used, and where people are trying to help solve the problem rather than a) be a part of it, or b) complain and finger-point. I believe that the only way we get through this - as a species - is together.

First of all, I love learning, but learning for the sake of learning is a little like masturbation (fun but unproductive beyond the moment but addictively feels more than it is), so for a while I’ve always seemed to “concentrate” my learning on systematic and structural fields, (Economics, Politics, Psychology, Music, Technology and Design Thinking, Physics, Communication/Knowledge Sharing, Religion, History), not necessarily fundamental perspectives but many major lenses to observe the world and systems though. It’s why I’m not a specialist it’s impossible to be a specialist in so many complex fields of human study. Basically TED conference videos are like crack for me.I’ve been an active member of numerous communities online for over 20+ years, I was a fairly early adopter of the internet to find my tribe (if you haven’t guessed I was a weird kid). I don’t have a tribe and I’ve looked all over (gaming clans/communities, self-help/psychology forums, music technology groups, political movements) I’m an intellectual wanderer that doesn’t fit in a single easy label and something else is always interesting, I’m a contrarian when it suits, argumentative, opinionated while trying my hardest to be inclusive, I’ll learn from anyone and from anywhere if I can although I talk so much it can be overwhelming to try teaching me.I came here to help, I knew I couldn’t help with specific data science questions or programming syntax but I hoped I could help somehow and I trusted that I would work out the &quot;what&quot; when I arrived at the problem. I knew things would need organising, it’s grunt work, usually uninteresting and often invisible but it’s a prerequisite for developing and sharing knowledge not just processing data. I saw the potential for a powerful inspiring movement starting in CoronaWhy, something to help push and pressure the lazy/disconnected system leaders into fundamental systemic change globally, my word is the world overdue some systemic changes. I wanted to be part of that movement and a bit of my ego wanted to help build it, it’s a permanent struggle to quieten the part of myself that wants personal external validation and “proof” of my capabilities it comes with not being a “proven” specialist in anything. Mostly I want to just be in the “room” while the smarter specialists are actually solving the real problems but I want to make sure everyone can communicate what they really mean because it’s not just language and cultural barriers that impede communication but specialists with the curse of knowledge that can’t reframe and express their ideas and knowledge to non-specialists.<strong><em>What do you want to achieve?</em></strong><br>Personally, some quantifiable evidence that I personally can help build something impactful (the egoist in me). More important than that I want to help save lives, support people and help humanity overcome the roadblocks to humanist justice and environmental equilibrium all the while obviously reducing the not just the damage of COVID-19 but also any equally future problems that only global thinking will overcome. Fundamentally it’s a diverse tribe that I will be able to network with and will hopefully help slake my unquenchable thirst for knowledge, but rather than trying to learn everything I know I need to build trust in others skills to really do the amazing job I’m already seeing.<strong><em>Is it learning new skills or a hobby?</em></strong><br>In time like any role, I’ve no doubt I will learn more programming skills outside my very limited Python and superficial web development knowledge, hopefully I will get to practice more UX research and strategic team planning and hopefully refine my overly verbose meandering writing style.<strong><em>Do you want to change the world or are you more practical and what to have an immediate impact on COVID-19 as much as you can?</em></strong><br>Both, I want the world to be changed but for it to be changed incremental steps need to be developed. We need to make the barrier to change seem so low that the potential upside makes it worth the risk.PS sorry for the long post.

His work was recognised when he was awarded an MBE for services to medicine.Uncle Norm opened my young kiwi eyes to the wonders of the world and taught me the concept that we could learn a lot from other cultures and did not need to fear them.

As a zoologist  we look at humans and non-human animals as equals.

It was a closed source project (written in Forth) and was used by a researcher to defend her dissertation in the field of polymer curing. It found its way into honors high school biology classes as a programmable question-answering platform (albeit, nothing as sophisticated as we see today). But, when I explained to Engelbart that my intention was to have an <em>apparent IQ</em> - the IQ of my computer program and my own brain - far higher than either alone, he asked &quot;What&#x27;s this <em>me stuff</em>?&quot; I immediately migrated from a <em>me</em> to <em>we</em> outlook, and began developing open source platforms <em>for us</em>. After meeting Engelbart, I became engaged in working with an international team to map SGML topic maps out to XML (never mind we now do them in JSON as well). From that, I edited and co-authored a book on topic maps; a few years later, I discovered a PDF clone of my book online at the University of Tehran. You can download that from this link (keep in mind, the book is nearly 20 years old - it&#x27;s highly dated, but it still introduces the topic)<br><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w8Jephtt0kDjNInmzI5YPl51Jcw7hpVF/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w8Jephtt0kDjNInmzI5YPl51Jcw7hpVF/view?usp=sharing</a><strong>1</strong>2<strong>Monday, July 13th</strong><a target="_blank" href="https://app.slack.com/team/U016U0QJ8RL"><strong>Shruti Wagle</strong></a>  <a href="https://coronawhy.slack.com/archives/C012GHVEFLZ/p1594671215481500">1:13 PM</a><br>Hi, I have joined this channel to do my small part in eradicating this coronavirus pandemic.<strong>Yesterday</strong><a target="_blank" href="https://app.slack.com/team/U017DJLUKK3"><strong>Alex Fisher</strong></a>  <a href="https://coronawhy.slack.com/archives/C012GHVEFLZ/p1594754066486300">12:14 PM</a><br>As well as wanting to help with the problem at hand, I firmly believe that the digital age has given us the resources to pool the capacities&#x27; of individuals to address expansive global issues.
